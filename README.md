Habits is a web project developed during NLW Setup.
With it, it is possible to manage daily tasks/habits and visualize how often they are carried out in the long term.

## Techs:
The application was built with **vite**, from a **react-ts** template. Strategies used:
- **Tailwindcss** for styling;
- **Typescript** in data typing;
- **phosphor-react** for availability of icons;
- **Axios** for API requests;
- **Dayjs** for date manipulation;
- **Clsx** for manipulation of html classes in javascript files;
- **Radix-ui** for use of "off-the-shelf" and accessible components.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: *git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/nlw-setup-web.git*;
- Enter the project folder and do: *npm install*. When all packages are installed, do *npm run dev* to start in development mode.
- Remember that to work correctly, it is necessary that the server is working correctly (Available in https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-setup-ignite/tree/main/server). 
Modify the api baseURL if necessary.
